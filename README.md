# County Replication

The purpose of this script is to automate data preparation for synchronzing changes with the other municipalities in Williamson County. The City of Round Rock has moved to ArcGIS Pro and is leveraging Attribute Rules. As a result, municipalities that are still using ArcMap will encounter compatability issues when synchronizing with us. This script alleviates that issue by removing the attribute rules and re-adding them afterword.
